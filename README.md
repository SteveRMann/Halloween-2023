## PrizeDelivery
This repository contains the files for the Halloween prize delivery mechanism.

The mechanism is a rotisserie motor that rotates on command (a button press).
Once started, the motor continues until a "home" microswitch is closed.
Because the motor is slow, like 20 seconds for 360Â°, the "home" position is 
just before a drop would occur.
